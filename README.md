# Code Challenge
## Binary Trees Review

## Directions
1. Fork and Clone this Lab
2. Write tests and solutions for the following exercises.

* **Traversal:** Implement an `inorder` traversal. This functions should take a root node as an input and return an array of all of nodes in the tree listed in order of its inorder traversal.
  
* **Univalued Binary Tree:** A binary tree is univalued if every node in the tree has the same value. Write a function `is_unival_tree`, that takes a Tree as a parameter and returns true if and only if the given tree is univalued.
